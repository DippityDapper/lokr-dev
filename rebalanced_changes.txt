LOKR PROPOSED BALANCE CHANGES
*Most of these changes have been suggested in the rebalanced discussion, but a fair few of them were my own ideas.*

REG'SON
 - 	HP increased to 9/11/13; +3 at levels 1 and 2, +2 at level 3
 -	Armor decreased to 0/0/0; -2 at all levels
 -	Attack increased to 5/7/9; +1 at level 3
 -	Eldritch Heal: now heals when an enemy is killed within range 3 of him, regardless of whether he is the one to kill it
 -	Eldritch Siphon: now receives –[level] magic damage (this I've written in the game files, not sure if it works in-game yet)
 -	Eldritch Blades: true damage strike increased to floor([attack]/2) (now he actually deals damage equivalent to his attack stat, instead of a puny 4 damage at level 1)
 -	Shadow Uppercut (melee): damage increased to [attack]+2 (brings it in line with pretty much every other "strong" melee physical attack)

GERALD LIGHTSEEKER
 -	Divine Blade: damage increased to floor(4*[attack]/3) true damage, remains a full action (it would also possibly make sense to give it [attack] damage but make it a regular action)
 -	Avenging Blade: damage increased to [attack]+[missing HP] (basically just un-nerfed it)
 -	Martyr’s Prayer: healing increased to 6 HP

ASRA
 -	Spider Bite: epic effect now inflicts sleep for 2 turns in addition to dealing 3 bonus true damage (2-turn sleep duration is usually redundant as the poison will wake the target up after 1 turn, but against poison-immune enemies the full duration might be useful) 

OLOCH
 -	Burning Claw: damage increased to [attack]-2, cooldown reduced to 2, epic effect now stuns weakened enemies
 -	Fire Barrier: changes already implemented

BRUXA
 -	Attack increased to 5/6/8; +1 at all levels (hopefully should make her viability at least similar to Oloch's now)
 -	Voodoo Doll: each hit on the doll now deals [damage]+1 to the target (works the same as damage reduction but in the opposite direction)

BRAVEBARK
 -	Seismic Pound: changed to a regular action (it isn't a particularly strong skill anyway, so having it be a full action made no sense)

DARK KNIGHT
 -	HP increased to 5/6/7; +1 at all levels
 -	Armor decreased to 6/7/8; -1 at all levels (still has the highest armor stat of any companion, but at least now isn't completely useless against non-physical attacks)
 -	Impervious: duration decreased to 2 turns, now grants -2 damage reduction for the duration (now actually lives up to its name, and should mean that the Dark Knight doesn't take damage from negative status effects, though that obviously requires a shorter duration)
 -	Soulstrike: changed to a regular action, now deals true damage and heals the Dark Knight by the same damage, epic effect grants the dark knight +2 attack for 2 turns if the target dies (now there are two equally-viable upgrade paths with the dark knight: the damage-focused path with spiked reforge and porcupine slam, and the tanking-focused path with impervious and soul strike)

KNIGHT
 -	HP increased to 6/7/9; +1 at all levels
 -	Armor decreased to 5/6/8; -1 at all levels (only done to distinguish from the revamped Dark Knight and should also make it more feasible for her to tank against non-physical damage)

WITCH DOCTOR
 -	Range increased to 4/5/6; +1 increase at level 1
 -	Shamanic Heal: heal changed to [attack]
 -	Force of Nature: pull increased to 2 hexes, push increased to 3 hexes (makes it actually do something potentially useful instead of being just another damage skill)
 -	Tainted Healing: range increased to [range] (no reason for it to be a lower range than his basic attack)
 -	Healing Totem: heal increased to 2 HP/turn (strength is now more fitting of its full action status)

SORCERESS
 -	Rotting Curse: cooldown reduced to 3 (the skill is not strong at all, so a 4-turn cooldown was ridiculous)
 -	Punishing Curse: damage multiplier changed to [level]+2, cooldown reduced to 0 (not sure why, but cooldown seems to be bugged to remain at 2 in-game)
 -	Trebuchet: now applies rooted for 1 turn to all targets hit by splash damage (1-hex area)

Sasquatch
 -	Attack increased to 5/6/7; +1 at all levels (for a slow-moving unit with no armor and such lackluster regeneration, his attack stat desperately needed a buff)
 -	Mudball Throw: cooldown reduced to 2
 -	Mighty Blow: damage increased to [attack]+2, adds epic effect to stun target for an extra turn if weakened (might be a bit too strong now, but we'll see)
 -	Abominable Chomp: damage and heal increased to ceil(2*[attack]/3), adds epic effect to inflict bleed if target is immobilized (given that his only reliable healing skill is locked behind level 3, it needs to be at least worthwile to use over his group stun)

SYLVAN ELF
 -	Living Bow: damage changed to ceil(4*[attack]/5) (this makes damage without any sharpening stones equal to 3/4/4 instead of 3/3/4)
 -	Woodland Stride: damage increased to ceil(4*[attack]/5)) (is still worse than Skirmish, but it is at least viable now)

BARBARIAN
 -	Gains 1 innate health regeneration when not poisoned
 -	Berserk chance increased to 50%
 -	Berserk now heals only +1 HP (combined with innate regeneration, net heal should still be +2 when berserk)
 -	Berserk Ritual: heal/epic heal decreased to 1/3 (but total heal when not bleeding is still the same; ideally this will make his second L2 skill more viable since berserk ritual now isn’t the only way for the Barbarian to reliably heal himself)

CLERIC
 -	Attack increased to 4/5/6; +1 at levels 2 and 3 ()
 -	Armor decreased to 3/4/5; -1 at all levels (felt a bit too tanky especially at levels 2 and 3; 8 HP plus 6 armor would have made the Dark Knight and Knight much less viable especially considering the strength of the Cleric's support skills)
 -	Armor regen increased to 1/1/2 (this at least somewhat makes up for his armor nerf and his lack of the fortify trait)

ASSASSIN
-	Speed increased to 3/3/4
-	HP increased to 4/6/8
-	Attack increased to 5/6/7
-	Dodge chance changed to a flat 40% at all levels
-	Aimed Slash: epic backstab damage lowered to ceil([attack]/3)
-	Counterattack: changed to a free action and switched with quick step to level 3
-	Quick step: switched with counterattack to level 2
-	Backstab: epic effect increases dodge chance to 70% for 1 turn if target is killed

NECROMANCER
 -	HP increased to 4/5/6; +1 at level 3
 -	Damage increased to 3/4/6; +1 at level 3 (makes the upgrade from level 2 to 3 actually worth it now)

HIGH ENCHANTRESS
 -	HP decreased to 5/7/9; -1 at level 3 (+3 HP boost from level 2 to level 3 was overkill)
