SASQUATCH

-	Abominable Chomp: damage and heal increased to ceil(2*[attack]/3), adds epic effect to inflict bleed if target is immobilized

SYLVAN ELF
-	Living Bow: damage changed to ceil(4*[attack]/5); this makes base damage without any sharpening stones 3/4/4 instead of 3/3/4
-	Woodland Stride: damage increased to ceil(4*[attack]/5)

BARBARIAN
-	Gains 1 innate health regeneration when not bleeding
-	Berserk chance increased to 50%
-	Berserk now heals only +1 HP (combined with innate regeneration, net heal is still +2 when berserk)
-	Berserk Ritual: heal/epic heal decreased to 1/3 (but total heal when not bleeding is still the same); ideally this will make his second L2 skill more viable since berserk ritual now isn’t the only way for the Barbarian to reliably heal himself
